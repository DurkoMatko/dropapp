# README #

This app is just amazing, just wanted to say that. And it will become even more amazing, because in the parts where it might not be so amazing yet, it will change into amazingness...

This is build on top of Flip, the custom cms of Zinnebeeld. Which is why the structure might seem a little odd at first having a 'global' folder, etc... This was because it was serving multiple installations on one server. This may all be rebuild.

### What is this repository for? ###

To enable us to continue to develop this application into something even more beautiful and sustainable. Making it easy for us to work together with a bigger team even if we're not all on the same location.

### How do I get set up? ###

Je moet in flip/.htaccess dit als eerste regel hebben:


```
#!

php_value include_path "/Users/_username_/_websitefolder_/_market_folder_/50-back"
SetEnv BRANCH "username"
```

En in de config.php moet je even het 'username'-stukje aanpassen.
