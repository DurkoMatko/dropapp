# README #

You just found the Drop App - the revolutionary app to manage warehouses that supply clothing and other stuff to refugees in camps. As we developed it for Drop In The Ocean (http://www.drapenihavet.no/en/) and not primarily for other organizations, you will not find a lot of documentation. Installing, running and customizing it will be pretty much straight forward for a developer with knowledge of PHP and Mysql. However, you are pretty much on your own, at this moment we don't actively support or develop the application for others. 

### What is this repository for? ###

To enable us to continue to develop this application into something even more beautiful and sustainable. Making it easy for us to work together with a bigger team even if we're not all on the same location.

### How do I get set up? ###

Copy .htaccess.default and /lib/config.php.default and remove the .default in the filename.

Then change the necesary usernames, folders and database settings.

### Contribution guidelines ###
