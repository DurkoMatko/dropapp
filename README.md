Disclaimer: This is build on top of Flip, the custom cms of Zinnebeeld. Which is why the structure might seem a little odd at first having a 'global' folder, etc... This was because it was serving multiple installations on one server. This may all be rebuild.

### What is this repository for? ###

To enable us to continue to develop this application into something even more beautiful and sustainable. Making it easy for us to work together with a bigger team even if we're not all on the same location.

### How do I get set up? ###

I'm not sure at the moment what the difficulties will be to get this running on a new system. But it for sure needs php and mysql!

### Contribution guidelines ###

### Who do I talk to? ###
