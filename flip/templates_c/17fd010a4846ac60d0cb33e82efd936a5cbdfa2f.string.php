You look for alternatives. That is the way French tapestry artist Louise Perot Bonnell found out about the Amsterdamse Cultuurlening. She applied via Cultuur+Ondernemen, her request was accepted and now the loan enables her to fully focus on her art.</h4>
<p>"The art world is a very tough one", tells Louise Perot Bonnell, a French artist who has lived in the Netherlands for almost eight years now. "Art school was a cocoon, it didn&#8217;t prepare us for networking. I was na&#239;ve, hoped that people would just notice that my art was out there. But clearly you need to put yourself out there."&#160;</p>
<p>Bonnell came to the Netherlands for an exchange program. After a master&#8217;s degree in Medieval Literature, she decided she wanted something different than &#8216;spending time at the library&#8217;. She was already into design, and thought about becoming an artist. Art school seemed a good option: she applied for the Rietveld Academie and started doing Textile Design there in 2010.</p>
<p>Four years later, and she was out in the art world on her own. "I needed funding for my art, I couldn&#8217;t provide for it myself. Together with my Dutch partner, I tried to get a loan at a bank, but none of them would accept me. I was left without options. That was when I started looking online for other possibilities that focussed specifically on artistic work."</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="/product/amsterdamse-cultuurlening">Amsterdamse Cultuurlening</a>, a loan for artists and cultural organisations to realize their ambitions. The program is funded by the Amsterdam Fund for the Arts (Amsterdams Fonds voor de Kunst) and Cultuur+Ondernemen. At an interest rate of 3 percent, one can loan between &#8364; 1.000 and &#8364;&#160;15.000 to invest in their artistic career. Does it matter for the loan whether you are Dutch? Not exactly: the requirement is that either you are a Dutch artist, or you are an artist with a residence permit and a Dutch address.</p>
<p>"To be honest, I thought it would be hard to get the loan", admits Bonnell. She was pleasantly surprised by the procedure: "The advisors are very friendly and positive. They do want to see your portfolio, but in contrast to other programs, they don&#8217;t go in all sorts of artistic details. It matters most that you&#8217;re a serious and professional artist. The focus will be on how you will repay the debt." And once you get the loan, it&#8217;s not &#8216;we give you money and ciao&#8217;, as Bonnell describes it. "You are actually required to spend a part of the money on training or mentoring, so the support is good."</p>
<p>And now Bonnell has the money, what is she using it for? "Supplies and machinery to make my carpets. And some marketing, as I need to promote my work." She is satisfied that she has funding for her art now: "For the next year or so, I don&#8217;t need to think too much about money, and I can finally be fully focussed on my artistic career."&#160;</p>
