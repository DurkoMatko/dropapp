<p>I like to focus on issues surrounding internationalism in art and how artists can make themselves more visible, independent and selfsufficient on the international scene.</p>

<p>Charlie Citron (1958) is a sculptor, photographer and artist curator. He was born in New York, studied art history in the United States and attended the Rijksacademie from 1986-1988. He has participated in many international exhibitions in New York, Europe and Asia ranging from museums, galleries, residencies, on-site events and community projects.</p>
<p>Recent exhibitions and projects include group shows such as: 'Hotel de Inmigrantes', 'Cosmopolitan Stranger' as part of Manifesta 9, 'Plan D' (Du&#776;sseldorf),&#160; 'Hopper-Re-Imagined' (Edward Hopper House New York), 'Autonomy Zones' (Czech Republic), 'Retour NY-Amsterdam' at the Frankendael Huis (Amsterdam), 'The Griffis International Sculpture Garden', in Rome, New York, and in Lithuania, Ljubljana, Poznan and Venice during the 2009 Bi&#235;nnale.</p>
<p>He has a lot of experience teaching and giving lectures all over the world and has been teaching the course Art &amp; Internationalism at Cultuur+Ondernemen&#160; since 2005. Charlie Citron: &#8216;My first objective as a mentor is to understand the professional goals and aspirations of the artist. We review together how their personal strategies are synchronized with their goals, to create dialogue around the quality of the work, career opportunities, and how to solve practical and artistic problems in each professional situation. I focus on issues surrounding internationalism and how artists can make themselves more visible, independent and self-sufficient on both the local and international scene. '&#160;</p>
<p>'Each artist has to bring portfolios to the meetings and have projects that they would like to discuss. Presentations, writing about your work, studio and gallery visits, role-playing and practical discussions are important. Self-empowerment via financial support, the market place, alternative initiatives and how to realize your projects at each stage of development will be key in the talks.'</p>
<p>'There are many different art worlds. Every community is a potential niche for artistic activity. This can be in a museum, a gallery, a village, on-site event, public project or intervention. Diversity creates opportunities for an artist and stimulates artistic growth, dialogue and production. This awareness of potential enables you to discover and choose in which context to participate and realize your goals.'</p>
<p>'I am very open to mentor artists at many different stages of development. My philosophy is to help you achieve more satisfying and successful results in your work and public communication. I will ask questions about how you feel as an artist given different situations, to make visible your artistic patterns and choices, so you can anticipate and create personal strategies that will help you understand and navigate the changing rules of the game.&#8217; &#160;</p>
<p>'During the past years, each artist has a different way of expressing and communicating the meanings and qualities in their work, which is important to their projects that we work on together. This included writing texts and editing portfolios for subsidy applications, project proposals, and presentations for galleries, residencies, and postgraduate education. Along with one-to-one meetings and studio visits, I also emphasize interaction and dialogue via visits to museums, galleries, and art initiatives.&#8217;</p>
