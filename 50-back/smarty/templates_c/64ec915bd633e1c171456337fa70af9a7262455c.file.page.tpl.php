				<h1>Project description</h1>
				<p><strong>TRANSIT</strong> (<strong>TRAN</strong>sformative <strong>S</strong>ocial <strong>I</strong>nnovation <strong>T</strong>heory) is an ambitious research project that will develop a theory of transformative social innovation which is about empowerment and change in society. It is co-funded by the European Commission and runs for four years, from January 2014 until December 2017. TRANSIT will utilize a research method which encourages feedback from social entrepreneurs and innovators, policy makers and academics to develop a theory with practical relevance. The theory will be based on insights from other theories e.g. transition theory, social movement theory and institutional theory. The research project studies how social innovation can bring about empowerment and societal transformation.</p>

				<h1>Conceptual focus</h1>
				<p>TRANSIT is structured around 4 thematic focus areas: governance, social learning, funding and monitoring. We will develop theoretical and practically relevant insights for those thematic areas, which will form the basis for policy briefs and capacity building tools. Examples of questions that will be addressed include: what forms of governance facilitate transformative social innovation?; how can funding mechanisms become more effective? TRANSIT also zooms in on the effects of macro trends in society, such as the financial crisis, climate change and the ICT-revolution, which we refer to as ‘game changers’. It aims to develop insights about interpreting future changes (that can be used in e.g. forecasting and scenario planning tools) and about improving our effectiveness while working in changing circumstances. In conclusion TRANSIT aspires to develop interdisciplinary theory by analysing practical examples of social innovation and by translating this theory into practical insights and capacity building tools.</p>
